 COVID-19 Global Analysis

Hi! This is Syed Zayaan Ali from B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology.This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the global COVID-19 pandemic, using Python and real-world data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.

---

 Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze the global impact of COVID-19 by exploring key indicators such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and continent-level data. The analysis helps understand how the virus spread, which countries were most affected, and how the numbers evolved over time.

 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loaded a publicly available COVID-19 dataset in `.csv` format.
   - Inspected data types, missing values, and basic statistics using `.info()`, `.describe()`, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and filtered unnecessary columns.
   - Checked for duplicates and corrected anomalies.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed total and new cases globally and by country.
   - Identified the top 10 countries with the highest case and death counts.
   - Compared continental data to understand the global spread.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Line plots showing global case trends over time.
   - Bar charts for top affected countries by deaths.
   - Pie charts to visualize continent-wise distributions.

Key Insights

- Countries like the USA, India, and Brazil were among the most affected in terms of total cases.
- A noticeable correlation was found between population size and number of cases.
- Europe and North America had the highest death tolls.
- The rate of new cases dropped significantly after mass vaccination began.

 Tools Required

- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `numpy`

 Conclusion

This project highlights the power of data analysis in understanding and communicating the impact of global events like pandemics. Through visualizations and data-driven insights, we can track the evolution of the virus and identify critical areas for intervention and policy planning.
